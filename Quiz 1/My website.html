<h1>Pathway to positive thinking</h1>

<p class="red-panel">For many years, I pretended to be happy. I read all the books, consulted with many professionals and had the blueprint for a positive, happy persona. On the outside, I appeared to be happy and confident, and on many occasions I was. Yet these feelings were fleeting. They were based on how I was feeling with others or in what I doing at the moment. However, the conversation I was having with myself was not constructive. It did not build my self-esteem.

Positive thinking was not my focus. I was always thinking about what I had not accomplished, things that were not going well, people who had hurt me, and things I could not control. I became exhausted. My body literally was telling me this path was no longer serving me. I was harboring negative feelings, getting sick often, and feeling sorry for myself. I let self-care go by the wayside.

It didnâ€™t just hurt me, but those around me. My relationships began to suffer; people could feel my funky energy brought forth by my negative thinking. Unfortunately, some of these relationships were severed beyond repair. I had a choice to make. I could delve into this positive thinking concept I had been preaching about to clients or continue this toxic cycle, threaten my mental and physical health, and miss out on the beauty of the world around me. So, I embarked on my positive thinking path.<p/>

<h2>How to get yourself to thinking positively</h2>

<div class="main-container">
<p>Self-talk involves the things you mentally tell yourself. Think of this as the inner voice inside your mind that analyzes how you perform and interact with the world around you. If your self-talk centers on negative thoughts, your self-esteem can suffer.

So what can you do to combat these negative self-talk patterns? One way to break the pattern is to start noticing when you have these thoughts and then actively work to change them. When you start thinking critical thoughts about yourself, take a moment to pause and assess.

Paying attention to your self-talk is a great place to start when trying to think more positively. If you notice that you tend to engage in negative self-talk, you can start looking for ways to change your thought patterns and reframe your interpretations of your own behaviors.

Stress management expert Elizabeth Scott advises people to start by noticing their thought patterns and then focus on changing these into more positive ones. When you catch yourself engaging in a negative thought, mentally telling yourself to "Stop" can help break the pattern.<p/>

<h3>Try humor</h3>

<p class="red-panel">It can be tough to stay optimistic when there is little humor or lightheartedness in your life. Even when you are facing challenges, it is important to remain open to laughter and fun. Sometimes, simply recognizing the potential humor in a situation can lessen your stress and brighten your outlook. Seeking out sources of humor such as watching a funny sitcom or reading jokes online can help you think more positive thoughts.<p/>

<h3>Cultivate optimism</h3>

<p>Learning to think positively is like strengthening a muscle; the more you use it, the stronger it will become. Researchers believe that your explanatory style, or how you explain events, is linked to whether you are an optimist or a pessimist.


Optimists tend to have a positive explanatory style. If you attribute good things that happen to your skill and effort, then you are probably an optimist. Pessimists, on the other hand, usually have a negative attributional style. If you credit these good events to outside forces, then you likely have a more pessimistic way of thinking.


The same principles hold true for how you explain negative events. Optimists tend to view bad or unfortunate events as isolated incidents that are outside of their control while pessimists see such things as more common and often blame themselves.

By taking a moment to analyze the event and ensure that you are giving yourself the credit you are due for the good things and not blaming yourself for things outside of your control, you can start to become more optimistic.</p>

<h3>Keep Practising</h3>

<div class="mouse">
<p>There is no on-off switch for positive thinking. Even if you are a natural-born optimist, positive thinking can take effort in the face of challenging situations. Like any goal, the key is to stick with it for the long-term. Even if you find yourself dwelling on negative thoughts, you can look for ways to minimize negative self-talk and cultivate a more optimistic outlook.

Finally, do not be afraid to enlist the help of friends and family. When you start engaging in negative thinking, call a friend or family member who you can count on to offer positive encouragement and feedback. Remember that to think positively, you need to nurture yourself. Investing energy in things you enjoy and surrounding yourself with optimistic people are just two ways that you can encourage positive thinking in your life.</p>
